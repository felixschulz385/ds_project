# Motivation

## General idea

Find wasted potential for renewable energies.

\begin{itemize}

\item Illustrate potentials for renewable energies in a user-friendly way
\begin{itemize}
\item Online application as information desk for municipalities and citizens
\item Alternative to complex expert reports
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

## General idea

Find wasted potential for renewable energies.

\begin{itemize}

\item Identify unused spaces that are not essential for nature or agriculture
\begin{itemize}
\item "Ears" shaped from highway slip roads
\item Sound insulation for major roads and railway tracks
\item Quarry lakes
\item Uneconomic agricultural land  
\end{itemize}

\item Possible extension
\begin{itemize}
\item How much potential is wasted through different laws of the federal states, e.g. distance rules to settlements?
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

## Inspiration

General goal: Identify unused spaces that are not essential for nature or agriculture.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='85%', fig.cap="Solar Park Lustnauer Ohren"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('presentations/fig/lustnauer_ohren.jpg'))
```
Current focus of the project: "Ears" shaped from highway slip roads.

# Plan

## Plan

\begin{itemize}
\item Collect map and geo data
\item Identify unused spaces with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
\begin{itemize}
\item Categorise the availability of the areas for renewable energies
\begin{itemize}
\item Potential categories: (1) The area has already been built on, (2) Small forests, (3) Free meadow area, ...
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Plan

\begin{itemize}
\item Combine CNN results with geographical and meteorological data
\begin{itemize}
\item Geographical details: Ground conditions and slope
\item Meteorological details: Sunshine hours, wind speed and direction (can be extended by calculations of the wind power density)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

# Data

## Map and Geo Data

Due to a good resolution for satellite images, we chose \textbf{Brandenburg} as a starting point.

\begin{itemize}
\item Geoportal.de: Satellite images (data from land surveying offices must be made available free of charge as of 2019)

\item OpenStreetMap: Street map data where driveways are already marked 
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: Use the coordinates of driveways as filter for downloading relevant satellite images
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

## Data on Motorway Slip Roads

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='33%', fig.cap="Motorway Slip Roads in Germany"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('presentations/fig/motorway_access.jpg'))
```
We would like to expand these coordinates by data on slip roads to federal highways.

## Geographical and Meteorological Data

Further evaluate identified candidate areas for renewable energies with:

\begin{itemize}
\item Geoportal.de: Topographical data
\item German Meteorological Service: Sunshine hours, wind power density (wind speed, wind direction, density of air)
\end{itemize}

Possible extensions with data on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Grid centrality
\item Impacts of climate change on the economic viability of agriculture, e.g. groundwater data
\end{itemize}

# Questions for Professor Papies

\begin{enumerate}
\item Are there other departments/chairs at the university that might have access to aerial photographs with a resolution of less than one metre? If so, is there a possibility to collaborate with them?
\end{enumerate}
