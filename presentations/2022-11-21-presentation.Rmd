# Motivation

## General idea

Find wasted potential for renewable energies.

\begin{itemize}

\item Illustrate potentials for renewable energies in a user-friendly way
\begin{itemize}
\item Online application as information desk for municipalities and citizens
\item Alternative to complex expert reports
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

## General idea

We are interested in the expansion of solar and wind power and would like to find suitable areas for this purpose.

\begin{itemize}

\item Identify unused spaces that are not essential for nature or agriculture
\begin{itemize}
\item Primary focus: "Ears" shaped from highway slip roads

\item Further ideas:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sound insulation for major roads and railway tracks
\item Quarry lakes
\item Uneconomic agricultural land
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\item Possible extension
\begin{itemize}
\item How much potential is wasted through different laws of the federal states, e.g. distance rules to settlements?
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

## Inspiration

General goal: Identify unused spaces that are not essential for nature or agriculture.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='85%', fig.cap="Solar Park Lustnauer Ohren"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('presentations/fig/lustnauer_ohren.jpg'))
```
Current focus of the project: "Ears" shaped from highway slip roads.

# Plan

## Plan

\begin{enumerate}
\item Collect map and geo data
\item Identify unused spaces with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
\begin{itemize}
\item Categorise the availability of the areas for renewable energies
\item Potential categories:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The area has already been built on
\item Small forests
\item Free meadow area
\item ...
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

## Plan
\begin{enumerate}[3]
\item Combine CNN results with geographical and meteorological data
\begin{itemize}
\item Geographical details: Ground conditions and slope
\item Meteorological details: Sunshine hours, wind speed and direction (can be extended by calculations of the wind power density)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

# Data

## Map and Geo Data

Due to a good resolution and a useful data format for images, we chose \textbf{Brandenburg} as a starting point.

\begin{itemize}
\item Geoportal.de: Aerial images (data from land surveying offices must be made publically available as of 2019)

\item OpenStreetMap: Street map data where driveways are already marked 
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: Use the coordinates of driveways as filter for downloading relevant images
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

## Data on Motorway Slip Roads

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='33%', fig.cap="Motorway Slip Roads in Germany"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('presentations/fig/motorway_access.jpg'))
```
We would like to expand these coordinates by data on slip roads to federal highways.

## Geographical and Meteorological Data

Further evaluate identified candidate areas for renewable energies with:

\begin{itemize}
\item Geoportal.de: Topographical data
\item German Meteorological Service: Sunshine hours, wind power density (wind speed, wind direction, density of air)
\end{itemize}

Possible extensions with data on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Grid centrality: Difficulty of connecting identified zones to existing grid
\item Evaluation of the usability of agricultural area, e.g. solar fields on low groundwater areas
\end{itemize}

# Questions for Professor Scholten

\begin{enumerate}
\item Do you have access to orthophotography with better ground resolution for  Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Bremen, Saarland?
\item Do you have access to topographical data (digital terrain model) that does not mark trees as uneven?
\item Do you have experience with neural network models for the classification of surface?
\item Do you have any ideas on how to calculate the land yield in order to weigh up whether it is worth exchanging agriculture for renewable energies?
\item Angle of sunlight?
\end{enumerate}
