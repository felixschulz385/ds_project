## Outline



## Motivation

- Germany has for the longest time relied heavily on coal and gas (25% in 2010)
- Climates pledges require a rapid transition to renewable energy

- Wind parks often face opposition from local communities
- Solar energy is a promising alternative because of its low footprint
- Photovoltaics (PV) can be installed in places with little alternative use
    - Most prominently: Roofs
    - But also: Artifical lakes, parking lots, highways

## PV in highway turnoffs: The idea

- Highway turnoffs are unattractive for most uses
- The city of Tübingen realized that they could be utilized for PV
- After several years of legal hassle, a site at the B28 in Lustnau is now the city's largest source of green energy

## Scaling across Germany

- How much potential for such projects is yet unused?
- We seek to answer this question by taking a closer look at the state of Brandenburg

## When is a turnoff suitable for PV?

- We held expert interviews with the Tübingen project lead and an expert geologist
