## Outline



## Motivation

- Germany has for the longest time relied heavily on coal and gas (25% in 2010)
- Climates pledges require a rapid transition to renewable energy

- Wind parks often face opposition from local communities
- Solar energy is a promising alternative because of its low footprint
- Photovoltaics (PV) can be installed in places with little alternative use
    - Most prominently: Roofs
    - But also: Artifical lakes, parking lots, highways

## PV in highway turnoffs: The idea

- Highway turnoffs are unattractive for most uses
- The city of Tübingen realized that they could be utilized for PV
- After several years of legal hassle, a site at the B28 in Lustnau is now the city's largest source of green energy

![](fig/lustnauer_ohren.jpg){width="800"}

## Scaling across Germany

- How much potential for such projects is yet unused?
- We seek to answer this question by taking a closer look at the state of Brandenburg

## When is a turnoff suitable for PV? 

- We held expert interviews with the Tübingen project lead and an expert geologist

## Insights from pilot project "Lustnauer Ohren"

* Pilot project: 8 weeks construction and 8 years approval (DER SPIEGEL, 2022)
* Nowadays:
    + More awareness and pressure from the public
    + Direct communication with the public via social media
      when bureaucratic hurdles arise
    + Consequently, authorities urged not to insist on 50-year-old regulations
    
## Derivation of the project's objective

* Illustrate potentials for renewable energies (PV) in a user-friendly way
  + Online application as information desk for municipalities and citizens
  + Alternative to complex expert reports
    
## Conclusions for contextual focus of our project

Driving factors for one-off costs due to construction and operating costs:

* Environmental assessment for compensation areas
  + Nature in a potential ear is under protection (§ 44 Naturschutz Gesetz)
  + PV plant is an encroachment on the landscape
  + Woody plants such as bushes and trees are assessed differently (i.a. according to size, age)
  + Compensation areas must be equivalent or greater and geographically close
  + If landowner of the ear has no free compensation areas, they need to be must be rented (lease fees)
    - landowner for federal roads is the Regional Council of the county (in German: Regierungsbezirk)
    - for motorways the Autobahn GmbH/ indirectly the federal government)

Note: The environmental assessment determines one-off costs and long-term profitability of the PV.

## Conclusions for our project from insights (pilot project)

Driving factors for one-off costs due to construction and operating costs:

* Distance to grid
* Meteorological details: Sunshine hours 
* Geographical details: Ground conditions and slope
* [Sky alignment of the road]
  + Due to the technical innovations of recent years, the factor is less important nowadays as PVs can be built more flexibly than in Lustnau (insight from interview with Prof. Thomas Scholten)
  
## Economic Model (Felix)

How is score calculated?
  
## Data (Felix)

Potentially cover the following:
* Data acquisition

<!---
The complexity and the effort of the data acquisition is considered in the grading of the project.
-->

* Data preparation

<!---
The data are read in and made ready for computation and estimation.
- different parts of the data sets are read in and merged
- correct identifiers for cross-sectional units (e.g., companies, brands, products, countries, persons) and for time points are generated
-->

* Data validation

<!---
The data should be validated, for example
- by generating descriptive statistics and figures and by identifying implausible observations and outliers
- criteria for validation, this process should also take place largely without the users’ intervention
-->

* Data analysis

<!---
The primary focus of the project is a relevant substantive question, which can, but does not necessarily have to be of an economic nature.
- relation between to variables (correlational or causal)
- prediction of economic conditions (predictive analytics)
- corresponding analysis should be implemented with adequate methods (traditional statistics or machine learning).
-->

* Data visualization

<!---
The structure and distribution of the data as well as the relations and results of the data analysis.

## Training data - Postdam 

First choice training dataset: Semantic Labeling Benchmark data for the German city Potsdam, provided by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS)

![](fig/potsdam_labels.png){height="500"}

| Label | Color |
|---------|---------|
| 1.) Impervious surfaces | white |
| 2.) Building | blue |
| 3.) Low vegetation | light-blue |
| 4.) Tree | green |
| 5.) Car | yellow |
| 6.) Clutter/background | red |

Data Source: 2D Semantic Labeling Contest - Potsdam. Available online: https://www.isprs.org/education/benchmarks/UrbanSemLab/default.aspx (accessed on 14 December 2022).

## Training data - Postdam 

Advantages
* Aerial images, not just satellite
  + High resolution (6,000 px × 6,000 px with 5 cm ground res.)
* Precise and reliable labeling
  + Best dataset for German pixel-based labels
  + Useful classes, apart from cars

Disadvantages
* Urban structures, whereas in ears more rural structures
  + Rural structures are characterised by greater contiguous areas, like forests
  + Narrow, detailed urban structure in training creates fuzzy predictions for ears
  + Giving greater weight to classes "tree" and "low vegetation"
    - Improves detection of organic structures
    - Good in detecting single trees, but not forests

Color Labels: White - Impervious surfaces; Light-blue - Low vegetation; Green - Tree

## Training data - China (regions of Nanjing, Changzhou and Wuhan)

Second choice training dataset: Land-cOVEr Domain Adaptive semantic segmentation (LoveDA) dataset
+ High spatial resolution land-cover mapping (spatial resolution of 30 cm)
+ Source Google Earth platform

![](fig/LoveDA_labels.jpeg){height="250"}

| Label | Color |
|---------|---------|
| 1.) Background | white |
| 2.) Building | blue |
| 3.) Road | light-blue |
| 4.) Water | green |
| 5.) Barren | yellow |
| 6.) Forest | red |
| 7.) Agriculture | red |
| 0.) Unknown | red |

## Training data - China (regions of Nanjing, Changzhou and Wuhan)

Advantages
* Dataset differentiates between rural and urban images
  + More rural scenes, but quite balanced dataset (2713 urban, 3274 rural)
* Dataset created with the intention of achieving model transferability
  + "[U]rban and rural scenes can show completely different geographical landscapes, and the inadequate [generalization] of these algorithms hinders city-level or national-level mapping" (Wang et al., 2022, p. 1)
  + Dataset encounters for: 1) multi-scale objects; 2) complex background samples; 3) inconsistent class distributions
  
Disadvantages
* Lower resolution than images from Brandenburg (30 cm vs. 20 cm, respectively)
* Satellite images (vs. aerial images from Brandenburg)
* [Less detailed labeling compared to Potsdam dataset]
  + Useful in training for the recognition of larger contiguous areas, but not individual trees

## Land cover classification

Goal: Detect features in aerial images

* Classes of interest
  + Agriculture
  + Buildings
  + Forest and Trees
  + Road
  + Other
  
<!--- Add picture of example ear here to stress out classes. -->
  
## Land cover classification

Analysis tool: Image segmentation
* Divide image into regions belonging to different semantic classes.
  + Task of pixel-based classification
  + Pixel-wise mask for each object in the image
* Output (class per pixel) is the same size as the input (pixel)

## Semantic Segmentation - UNet

* Output (class per pixel) is the same size as the input (pixel)
* Network consists of a contracting path (downsampling) and an expansive path (upsampling) (Stevens et al., 2020b)
  + Downsampling:
    - Specific, detailed detectors (e.g. texture, color, characterising shapes)
    - Information reduction to relevant feature information
  + Upsampling:
  - Combination of the feature and spatial information
  - Extracting high-resolution features
* U-shaped network architecture: Early breakthrough for image segmentation

| Model | Advantages | Disadv. |
|---------|---------|---------|
| UNet | - widely used basic segmentation model | - training from scratch
|      | - feedback from interim presentation | - model overfits to training data
|      | - good starting point | - labelled data not specific for our task

## Semantic Segmentation - ResNet50 + BigEarthNet (Sumbul et al., 2019)

* Residual networks (ResNets) allow very deep networks to be successfully trained (Stevens et al., 2020a)
  + Deep networks represent very complex functions
  + Problem with large networks: Gradient signal that goes to zero
   - Large number of multiplications, the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero 
  + Skip Connections: Additional layers do not hurt the model’s performance as regularisation will skip over them if those layers were not useful
  
## Semantic Segmentation - ResNet50 + BigEarthNet (Sumbul et al., 2019)
  
* Transfer learning using pre-trained model backbones
  + Transfer knowledge learned from source dataset (BigEarthNet) to target dataset (training)
  + Model can already extract more general image features (e.g. textures, shapes)
  
* Pre-trained on BigEarthNet dataset
  + Atmospherically corrected satellite images from different seasons
  + 10 European countries
  + multiple land-cover classes (tile classifcation task, not segmentation)

| Model | Advantages | Disadv. |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ResNet50 | - pre-trained weights | - trained for classification task
| + BigEarthNet | - seasonal satellite images | - inferior predictions
|      | - big dataset on European countries |

## Semantic Segmentation - ResNet101 + COCO (Lin et al., 2014)

* Pre-trained on COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset
  + Large-scale object detection and segmentation dataset
  + Recognition in context (background awareness)

| Model | Advantages | Disadv. |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ResNet101 | - pre-trained weights | - COCO dataset
| + COCO    | - segmentation task | - trained for *object* segmentation
|      | - superior predictions after few training iterations |
|      | - least overfitting |
|      | - complexity of model seems to fit task|

## Semantic Segmentation - ResNet101 + COCO - Results

* Recognition of small forest areas very good.
* Individual trees are partly not recognized.
* Shadow areas are not always clearly assigned.

![](fig/resnet101_pred3.jpeg){height="500"}
Color Labels: White - Impervious surfaces; Red - Road; Green - Trees

## Semantic Segmentation - ResNet101 + COCO - Results

* Agricultural areas are better recognized when they are planted.
* Similar results for single trees that are leafy or bare.

Color Labels: White - Impervious surfaces; Red - Road; Green - Trees; Yellow - Agricultur

## Semantic Segmentation - ResNet101 + COCO - Results

* Road recognition is so good that you could use it to identify the shape of an ear.
* Even small buildings in shaded areas are detected.
