# Motivation

## General idea

Find wasted potential for renewable energies.

\begin{itemize}

\item Illustrate potentials for renewable energies in a user-friendly way
\begin{itemize}
\item Online application as information desk for municipalities and citizens
\item Alternative to complex expert reports
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

## General idea

We are interested in the expansion of solar power and would like to find suitable areas for this purpose.
Suitable areas are unused spaces that are not essential for nature or agriculture. 

Primary focus: "Ears" shaped from highway slip roads.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='85%', fig.cap="Solar Park Lustnauer Ohren"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('presentations/fig/lustnauer_ohren.jpg'))
```

## General idea

Our contribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item Assess economic utilisation of the identified unused spaces
\begin{itemize}
\item Construction costs vs. Electricity feed
\end{itemize}
\item Assess scalability of idea
\item Tangibility of the general idea
\end{itemize}

# Plan

## Plan

\begin{enumerate}
\item Collect map and geo data
\item Identify unused spaces
\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluate the suitability of the "ears" for PV
\item Classifications identified with a neural network:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The area has already been built on
\item The area is overgrown (trees, bushes, ...)
\item Vacant meadow area
\item ...
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

## Plan
\begin{enumerate}[3]
\item Combine neural network results (landcover) with geographical and meteorological data
\begin{itemize}
\item Distance to grid
\item Meteorological details: Sunshine hours 
\item Sky alignment of the road
\item Geographical details: Ground conditions and slope
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

# Data

## Data acquisition: Map and Geo Data

Due to a good resolution and a useful data format for images, we chose \textbf{Brandenburg} as a starting point.

\begin{itemize}
\item Geoportal.de: Aerial images (data from land surveying offices must be made publically available as of 2019)

\item OpenStreetMap: Street map data where driveways are already marked 
\begin{itemize}
\item Use the coordinates of driveways as filter for downloading relevant images
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

## Data on Motorway Slip Roads

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='33%', fig.cap="Motorway Slip Roads in Germany"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('presentations/fig/motorway_access.jpg'))
```
We expand these coordinates by data on slip roads to federal highways.

## Geographical and Meteorological Data

Further evaluate identified candidate areas for renewable energies with:

\begin{itemize}
\item MaStR: Grid centrality (difficulty of connecting identified zones to existing grid)
\item German Meteorological Service: Sunshine hours (incl. cloud coverage and season)
\item Geoportal.de: Topographical data
\end{itemize}

## Data preparation/ validation

TO DO: Felix Bildchen

## Data analysis

TO DO: Marvin & Yvette (Trainingsdaten und ResNet)

Easy solution: Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Two-step identification (Boxes + Sequencing of relevant shapes)
Harder solution: Self-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Pixel-specific identification with data from competition

## Data visualization

TO DO: Jan htlm

Map with identified "ears"

Requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Location of ears in a selected area
\item Heat map: Colour code for suitability of ears (rating)
\item Features: Size of ear, classification of land coverage, solar hours, grid centrality, ...
\end{itemize}

# Outlook/ Questions

Any experience with landcover classification (remote sensing, image pixel level) based on a pre-trained neural network?
\begin{itemize}
\item Reference database for neural networks on this objective?
\item Access to pre-trained neural networks free of charge?
\end{itemize}
